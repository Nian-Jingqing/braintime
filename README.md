## Glossary
| **Toolbox term** | **description** |
| --- | --- |
| Brain time warping | a transformation of clock time data based on the phase dynamics of the warping signal |
| Clock time (CT) | time as sequences of seconds
| Brain time (BT) | time as sequences of cycles of an oscillation of interest
| Warping signal | an oscillatory signal that is assumed to clock the cognitive process of interest |
| Warping source | a data structure that contains potential warping signals (e.g., local field potentials, independent component analysis components, virtual channels) |
| Periodicity | rhythmic patterns of classification performance |


## Introduction
The premise behind the *Brain Time Toolbox* is that insofar a cognitive process is clocked by oscillations, analyses of the process's dynamics require a factoring in of the oscillations' dynamics. To this end, the toolbox implements **brain time warping**, an algorithm to transform electrophysiological data based on relevant oscillations selected by the user—the **warping signal**. This changes the data from clock time (seconds), closer to brain time (cycles). A secondary function of the toolbox is to use multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to detect the effects of the applied data transformation.
